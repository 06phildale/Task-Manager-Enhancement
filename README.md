# Task Manager Enhancement

## Objective

The Task Manager Enhancement project involved extending the functionality of an existing Python-based task management system. The goal was to implement features such as user registration validation, task editing, completion tracking, and generating detailed reports, while applying principles of abstraction and code modularity. This project demonstrates practical skills in Python development, file handling, and creating user-friendly command-line applications.

### Skills Learned

- Applying abstraction and modularity to simplify complex code structures.  
- Handling file input/output for user and task data management.  
- Implementing validation logic to prevent duplicate usernames.  
- Developing functionality for task editing and completion tracking.  
- Generating user-friendly reports including task and user overviews.  
- Enhancing error handling and data consistency in real-world applications.

## Steps

*Ref 1: User Registration*  
Implemented `reg_user` function with validation to prevent duplicate usernames and allow adding new users safely.

*Ref 2: Task Addition and Editing*  
Enhanced `add_task` and `view_mine` functions to allow assigning tasks, editing due dates, and marking tasks as complete.

*Ref 3: Viewing Tasks*  
Created `view_all` and `view_mine` functions to display tasks clearly with task numbers, due dates, and completion status.

*Ref 4: Report Generation*  
Implemented functionality to generate `task_overview.txt` and `user_overview.txt` with statistics on total tasks, completion rates, and overdue tasks.

*Ref 5: Menu and User Interaction*  
Refined the command-line menu to allow intuitive selection of actions and robust handling of invalid input.
